# Formation-IA- Introduction to Data Science
# Workshop Instructions
This axis handles data handling and visualization techniques, main tools and libraries. This mainly includes Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. 
This workshop starts by summarizing the main visualization techniques and types, push the learner to remember the role of the libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and how they work together in data visualization, and most importantly, the role of visualization to understand the data handled in every machine learning project, which represents the main source for building accurate AI solutions.
After the brief summary seen during the course, you can start executing these steps: 

<ol> #1. Download the choosen dataset (one dataset from the Padoc platform) locally. 
#2. Apply various data handling and visualizations (chart types) on the dataset using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. The chapter already contains some examples that the learner can make use of directly. Here is a link to a similar notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kstaud85/iris-data-visualization.
The learner can try here other chart types to assess his ability to handle different visualization techniques.
#3. Do the same using plotly. You can visit this link for more details: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dgomonov/advanced-iris-analysis-with-plotly 
#4. Apply the same libraries on another dataset of your choice. You can introduce Kaggle here, by visiting https://www.kaggle.com/ for datasets examples. This can be a home work for the learner to assess his understanding and how much he is comfortable using these libraries for data visualization in his own project. </ol>
